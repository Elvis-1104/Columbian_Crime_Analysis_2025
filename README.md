### 1. Objectives:

1. Identify high-crime geographic hotspots and dominant offense types.
2. Analyze temporal crime patterns by hour, day, and shift.
3. Understand relationships between crime types and methods
4. Evaluate crime distribution across wards, districts, PSAs, and neighborhoods.
5. Provide insights to support strategic policing decisions.

### 2. Tools & Technologies Used:

1. Python - Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Scipy(Chi-square Hyothesis Test)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Canva
4. MS Word

### 3. Key Analysis:

1. Crime aggregation by geographic units (Ward, PSA, District, Cluster).
2. Temporal analysis by hour, day, month, and shift.
3. Visualization using bar plots, line plots, and pie charts.
4. Chi-square test to examine association between crime shift and offense type.

### 4. Findings:

1. Crime is concentrated in specific neighborhood clusters and PSAs.
2. Evening shift reports the highest crime volume.
3. Theft-related offenses dominate across most regions and time periods.
4. A statistically significant association exists between crime shift and offense type.

### 5. Outputs:

1. Clean Dataset (csv)
2. Visualizations/Charts
